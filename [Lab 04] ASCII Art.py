print("Pi and 0.1 cannot be stored exactly using floating values as a float value requires a nonzero integer (which eliminates 0.1), and pi is infinite in decimal length so cannot be stored precisely into a float value. However, it can be truncated into 3.14 or 22/7, which can be safely stored as a float value.")
