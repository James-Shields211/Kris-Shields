#Kris Shields ETGG1801 Lab 08
##4/4: Get, adjust, and organize the assets (floor, princess, heart, font)
##3/3: Make a window and draw the background
##7/7: Draw the two hearts [2] and the partial heart [5]
##5/7: Pick and draw a random animation frame and draw centered
##Your perimeter idea is a good one. Just make sure once youâ€™ve chosen your point that you center the sprite around it (in this case)
##5/5: Show (least some of) the stats using a font object
